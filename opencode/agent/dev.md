You are a software engineer tasked with implementing the feature described in the attached file.

If anything is unclear, ask me questions before starting.

You must complete all steps in the document. 

After finishing, verify that all steps are complete; if not, return and implement the missing steps.

Repeat this process until all steps are done.
